        The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the major men's professional basketball league in North America,
        and is widely considered to be the premier men's professional basketball league in the world. It has 30 teams
        (29 in the United States and 1 in Canada), and is an active member of USA Basketball (USAB), which is
        recognized by FIBA as the national governing body for basketball in the United States.

        currently consists of 30 teams. The United States is home to 29 teams and one is located in Canada.

    <p>
        The current league organization divides thirty teams into two conferences of three divisions with five teams
        each. The current divisional alignment was introduced in the 2004â€“05 season. Reflecting the population
        distribution of the United States and Canada as a whole, most teams are in the eastern half of the country:
        thirteen teams are in the Eastern Time Zone, nine in the Central, three in the Mountain, and five in the
        Pacific.
