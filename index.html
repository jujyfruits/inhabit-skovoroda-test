        Tom Cruise (born Thomas Cruise Mapother IV; July 3, 1962) is an American actor and producer. Cruise has
        been nominated for three Academy Awards and has won three Golden Globe Awards. He started his career at
        age 19 in the 1981 film Endless Love. After portraying supporting roles in Taps (1981) and The Outsiders
        (1983), his first leading role was in the romantic comedy Risky Business, released in August 1983.
        Cruise became a full-fledged movie star after starring as Pete "Maverick" Mitchell in the action drama
        Top Gun (1986). One of the biggest movie stars in Hollywood,[2][3] Cruise starred in several more
        successful films in the 1980s, including the dramas The Color of Money (1986), Cocktail (1988), Rain Man
        (1988), and Born on the Fourth of July (1989).

        Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the Church of Scientology and its associated social programs, and
        credits it with helping him overcome dyslexia. In the 2000s, his criticisms of psychiatry and
        anti-depressant drugs, particularly therapy for 9/11 rescue workers, and efforts to promote Scientology
        as a religion in Europe, sparked controversies, as did a leaked video interview of him promoting
        Scientology.[6] </p>

        Thomas Cruise Mapother IV, better known as Tom Cruise, was born on July 3, 1962, in Syracuse, New York,
        to Mary and Thomas Mapother. Cruise's mother was an amateur actress and schoolteacher, and his father
        was an electrical engineer. His family moved around a great deal when Cruise was a child in order to
        accommodate his father's career.
        Cruise and Kidman hit the big screen together in Far and Away, but the movie is far from a blockbuster.
        The flop cost more than $45 million, but grosses only $50 million. Still, the couple return onscreen as
        husband and wife in director Stanley Kubrick's final film Eyes Wide Shut. Reflecting on the relationship
        between the famous pair and Kubrick, who died in March prior to the film's July 16, 1999 release,
        producer Jan Harlan told PEOPLE, "They and Stanley absolutely got on like a house on fire."
        Cruise's first big movie, Risky Business, opens. Dancing in his underwear, Cruise, 21, lands at the top
        of Hollywood. EW calls it a "teen comedy that had the unexpected grace of a screwball farce."
        Everyone knows Tom Cruise---or at least what he wants us to know. We know that he overcame a difficult
        childhood to star in astonishing array of blockbusters: Top Gun, Rain Man, Born on the Fourth of July, A
        Few Good Men, Interview with the Vampire, Jerry Maguire, three Mission: Impossible movies, War of the
        Worlds, and more. We know he has taken artistic chances, too, and as a result has earned three Academy
        Award nominations and three Golden Globes, along with the respect of acting legends like Paul Newman and
        Dustin Hoffman.
